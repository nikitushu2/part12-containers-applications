This project is a full-stack Todo application containerized with Docker, consisting of a React frontend (built with Vite), an Express.js backend, MongoDB for data storage, and Redis for caching. The application allows users to create, read, update, and delete todo items through a web interface. The architecture uses nginx as a reverse proxy to route requests between the frontend and backend services, with Docker Compose orchestrating the entire multi-container setup.
